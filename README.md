Hayden Qi, known online as DuckyProgramming, develops games online.

Most of my modern work is available on GitHub. Playable versions can also be found on OpenProcessing:

Movebuild, my magnum opus, is too large to run on OpenProcessing, and can be played on its GitHub page at:
https://duckyprogramming.github.io/MoveBuild/

My older work (very unimpressive) can be found on Khan Academy:
